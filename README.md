JS Project - simple chatbot
=======
It's one of my small projects for Software Development studies. My goal was to create a really simple chatbot.

# Requirements I fulfilled:
  - The application uses a content field, a text field, and a button to send messages
  - At the beginning, a welcome message from the bot should be sent, e.g. Hi, how's the JS class going?
  - In the text field, users can type a message and confirm it. It will cause showing a message in the content field and it will clear the text box.
  - Message can be sent by pressing the Enter key
  - For each user's message, the bot should send messages from itself
  - It is not important what the bot will answer, but it should be deterministic (it always responds the same to this message from the user). Prepare at least 3   answers.
  - The bot message should not work immediately. Simulate that the bot needs time to create its message.


Bot reacts to the messages: "Cześć", "Hej", "Do zobaczenia" and "Papa".
